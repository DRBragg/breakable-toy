# README

(WIP)

React on Rails application featuring WebCam recording. Users can record themselves in a mock interview with a variety of prompts and then play back their recording to see how they performed. Users can also have other users watch and then leave feedback.

I wanted to challenge myself to use a technology I had never used before. Learning to access, manipulate, and persist user WebCam footage was a super awesome and fun challenge.

Tech used:

* Ruby On Rail

* React

* React on Rails from ShakaCode

* WebRTC/RecordRTC

* PostgreSQL

Live Demo:
